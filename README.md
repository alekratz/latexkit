# LaTeXkit
A LaTeX renderer for XKit.

# Using
This requires XKit. You can find them at https://github.com/new-xkit/XKit

I have no idea how to distribute this thing! So for now, open up tumblr.com/xkit_editor and copy-paste the contents of the latexkit.js file into the Script (first) tab, and the contents of latexkit.icon.js into the Icon (third) tab.
